# On-Demand-Traffic-Control

The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically in that order.


Red means to stop, yellow means to get ready and green means that you can cross. These rules are applied for cars and pedestrians traffic lights.


There is a button for pedestrians to switch the mode of the system to the pedestrian mode.


Pedestrian mode allows people to stop cars and cross streets.
